**hold onto the stories**

  

By Henry H. Walker

_work at remembering_

  

CFS approached its 60th anniversary

of working to be there for its students,

to be there so that staff can find their way

onto a path that lets them share

the gifts of who they are,

as the students share the gifts of who they are,

  

it seemed important to me

to record and share the stories

that our aging staff lived with the fullness of themselves,

as they answered the calling that grabbed them at their heart,

so a way opened,

and many of CFS's former staff stepped forward

and risked the opening of their hearts

and the crafting of their words

**Are You an Authentic Leader or an Authentic Jerk?**

  

By Hannes Leroy, Michael A. Daniels, Kristin L. Cullen-Lester, and Alexandra Gerbasi

Have you ever been told you have a “strong personality” or that you are very direct? Has anyone ever called you strong-willed or, worse, a moral crusader? If so, you might be walking a fine line between authenticity and abrasiveness. At a time when “bringing your whole self” to work is often praised, it’s easy to mistake bluntness for integrity and rigidity for principle. Authenticity can turn toxic when your intention to stay true to yourself begins to crowd out curiosity, collaboration, or care for how others experience you.

Chances are, you’ve heard labels like the ones above tossed around or maybe even directed at you. They often sound harmless — in our experience, the target of such remarks may even consider them flattering — but they may be intended as a corrective critique.
