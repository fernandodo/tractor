10:33 chatgpt时代，知识的掌握和获得更容易，知识已经变成活的。机器和人的竞赛。作为人类个体，必须跑赢AI，或者跑赢同领域的个人。策略：找人比AI强的领域（包括AI未涉及，或者AI不删除），或者融汇贯通。AI，目前从本质上是文字/图像/视频训练下的熟能生巧。我必须更有创造力。

**How AI is breaking cover letters**

  

…

Comparing pre- and post-ChatGPT activity, two results stand out. The first is that cover letters have lengthened. In the pre-LLM era, the median one was 79 words long.

…

The subset of applications written using the tool—the only ones that can be definitively labelled as AI-generated—are longer still, with a median length of 159 words, more than twice the human-written baseline.

The second is that firms have stopped caring about what is written. When only some applications contain evidence an employee has put in effort, they are likely to be from the best workers—and thus all letters are worth reading closely to identify strong candidates. When all letters show evidence of “effort”, there is little benefit in reading any.
