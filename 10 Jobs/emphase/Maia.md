Hey Fei,

Hope you’re doing well. I am doing a bit of recruitment for a new project with Enphase down in Christchurch. I am not able to say much about the details as it is sensitive in nature, but your background is really interesting and I’d love to have a phone chat with you to see if the position strikes interest?

Please let me know when you’re available. If not for you, perhaps there is someone you could recommend.

Looking forward to hearing from you!
