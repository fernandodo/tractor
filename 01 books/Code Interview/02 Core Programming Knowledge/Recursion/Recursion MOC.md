# Recursion MOC

## Overview
Programming technique where functions call themselves to solve problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.

## Key Topics

### Recursion Fundamentals
- [[Recursive vs iterative solutions]]
- [[Base case vs recursive case]]
- [[Tail recursion and compiler optimizations]]
- [[Wrapper functions for recursion]]

### Common Applications
- [[Common recursive problems - factorial binary search string permutations tree traversal]]
- [[Recursion inefficiency vs iterative alternatives]]
