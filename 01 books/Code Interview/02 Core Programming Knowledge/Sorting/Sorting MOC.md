# Sorting MOC

## Overview
Algorithms for arranging data in order, with different trade-offs in time complexity, space usage, and stability.

## Key Topics

### Algorithm Selection
- [[Algorithm selection criteria - data size memory stability]]

### Sorting Algorithms
- [[Selection sort - O(n²) few swaps]]
- [[Insertion sort - O(n) best case O(n²) worst case]]
- [[Quicksort - O(n log n) average O(n²) worst case bad pivot]]
- [[Merge sort - O(n log n) stable external sorting]]
- [[Heap sort via heaps]]

### Applications
- [[Sorting problems - merging sorted lists algorithm trade-offs]]
