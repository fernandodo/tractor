# Trees and Graphs MOC

## Overview
Hierarchical and networked data structures for complex relationships and efficient searching.

## Key Topics

### Tree Fundamentals
- [[Tree basics - root parent child ancestor descendant leaves]]
- [[Binary trees and binary search trees BSTs]]
- [[Lookup complexity - O(log n) vs O(n) in skewed trees]]
- [[Heaps - min-heap max-heap priority queue use cases]]

### Traversal Methods
- [[Tree traversals - preorder inorder postorder]]
- [[BFS vs DFS in trees]]

### Graph Structures
- [[Graphs - directed-undirected adjacency list-matrix]]
- [[Graph cycles and traversal algorithms]]
