# Phone Screens by Recruiters: Rigid Q&A

## Overview
Non-technical phone screens conducted by HR recruiters focusing on standardized questions and cultural fit assessment.

## Key Characteristics

### Structured Format
- **Standardized Questions**: Same questions asked to all candidates
- **Checklist Approach**: Recruiters follow predetermined scripts
- **Limited Flexibility**: Little room for deviation from standard format
- **Time-Boxed**: Usually 15-30 minutes with strict time limits

### Common Question Categories
- **Background Verification**: Education, work history, timeline gaps
- **Basic Role Understanding**: "What do you know about this position?"
- **Motivation**: "Why are you interested in our company?"
- **Availability**: Start date, relocation willingness, salary expectations
- **Cultural Fit**: Team work examples, handling conflict

## Preparation Strategies

### Research Company Basics
```cpp
// Think of preparation like structured data access
struct CompanyInfo {
    string mission;
    vector<string> products;
    vector<string> values;
    string recent_news;
};

// Prepare key talking points
CompanyInfo company = {
    "Mission statement from website",
    {"Product 1", "Product 2", "Product 3"},
    {"Value 1", "Value 2", "Value 3"},
    "Recent funding/product launch/news"
};
```

### Prepare Standard Responses
- **Elevator Pitch**: 60-second professional summary
- **Why This Company**: 2-3 specific reasons
- **Career Goals**: Short and long-term aligned with role
- **Questions for Them**: 3-5 thoughtful questions about role/company

## Common Pitfalls
- **Over-Technical Answers**: Recruiters may not understand technical details
- **Salary Discussion Too Early**: Let them bring up compensation first
- **Negative Previous Employer Comments**: Always stay professional
- **Unprepared for Basic Questions**: "Tell me about yourself" should be rehearsed

## Success Indicators
- Recruiter schedules technical interview
- Detailed discussion of next steps
- Introduction to hiring manager
- Request for additional materials (portfolio, references)
