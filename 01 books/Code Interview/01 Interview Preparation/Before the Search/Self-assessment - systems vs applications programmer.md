- **Skills**: Low-level programming, memory management, hardware interaction
- **Languages**: C, C++, Assembly, Rust
- **Challenges**: Performance optimization, resource constraints

### Applications Programming
- **Focus**: User-facing software, business applications, web development
- **Skills**: UI/UX design, business logic, user experience
- **Languages**: Java, Python, JavaScript, C#
