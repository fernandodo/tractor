# Architect vs Coder Roles

## Overview
Understanding the distinction between software architect and coder roles to guide career path decisions.

## Key Differences

### Software Architect
- **Focus**: High-level system design, technology decisions, architectural patterns
- **Skills**: System design, technology evaluation, communication, leadership
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Define system architecture and technical standards
  - Guide technology choices and integration strategies
  - Mentor development teams and review designs
  - Bridge business requirements with technical solutions
- **Time Allocation**: 70% design/planning, 30% hands-on coding

### Coder/Developer
- **Focus**: Implementation, feature development, bug fixes
- **Skills**: Programming languages, algorithms, debugging, testing
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Write clean, efficient code
  - Implement features according to specifications
  - Debug and maintain existing systems
  - Collaborate with team members on code reviews
- **Time Allocation**: 80% hands-on coding, 20% design/planning

## Career Progression Considerations
- **Architect Path**: Requires strong technical foundation plus communication skills
- **Coder Path**: Deep technical expertise, specialization opportunities
- **Hybrid Roles**: Tech leads, senior engineers who do both

## Self-Assessment Questions
- Do you enjoy high-level system design or detailed implementation?
- Are you comfortable with less hands-on coding time?
- Do you want to influence technology decisions across teams?
- Do you prefer solving complex technical problems or architectural challenges?
