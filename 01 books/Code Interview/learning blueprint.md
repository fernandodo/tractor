Here’s a **structured learning blueprint** in English, formatted exactly as you requested.  
It organizes the uploaded _Programming Interviews Exposed (4th Edition)_ content into **macro categories (H2)**, **subtopics (H3)**, and **atomic knowledge points (unordered lists)**—ready to be turned into Obsidian atomic notes.

# Learning Blueprint for Programming Interviews

## Interview Preparation

### Before the Search

- Self-assessment: systems vs. applications programmer
    
- UI/UX programming vs. backend coding
    
- Debugging and maintenance work
    
- Testing / QA fundamentals
    
- Architect vs. coder roles
    
- Management vs. technical career paths
    
- Big company vs. startup trade-offs
    
- Open source vs. proprietary development
    
- Long-term vs. short-term projects
    
- Job market research (social networks, job boards, books, courses)
    

### Job Application Process

- Finding companies (large, medium, small, startups)
    
- Referrals and networking
    
- Working with headhunters
    
- Direct company applications
    
- Job fairs and college career centers
    
- Online platforms (LinkedIn, AngelList, HackerRank, Hired)
    

### The Phone Screen

- Purpose: weed out unqualified candidates
    
- Phone screens by engineers (basic coding + design tasks)
    
- Phone screens by recruiters (rigid Q&A)
    
- Automated screenings (MCQs, coding platforms)
    
- Preparation: quiet environment, headset, notes
    
- Answering strategies: ambiguity handling, multiple synonyms

## Core Programming Knowledge

### Arrays and Strings

- Array basics: contiguous memory, O(1) access, O(n) insert/delete
    
- Static vs. dynamic arrays
    
- Language-specific pitfalls (C, C++, Java, C#, JavaScript)
    
- Strings: encoding (ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16), immutability, manipulation
    
- Common string problems (first non-repeated char, substring search)
    

### Linked Lists

- Singly linked lists (head, tail, traversal)
    
- Doubly linked lists (bi-directional traversal)
    
- Circular linked lists (cycle detection)
    
- Head pointer management
    
- Safe traversal and error handling
    
- Insert/delete operations (pointer adjustment)
    
- Stack implementation with linked lists
    
- Tail pointer maintenance
    

### Trees and Graphs

- Tree basics: root, parent, child, ancestor, descendant, leaves
    
- Binary trees and binary search trees (BSTs)
    
- Lookup complexity (O(log n) vs O(n) in skewed trees)
    
- Heaps (min-heap, max-heap, priority queue use cases)
    
- Tree traversals: preorder, inorder, postorder
    
- BFS vs. DFS in trees
    
- Graphs: directed/undirected, adjacency list/matrix
    
- Graph cycles and traversal algorithms
    

### Recursion

- Recursive vs. iterative solutions
    
- Base case vs. recursive case
    
- Tail recursion and compiler optimizations
    
- Wrapper functions for recursion
    
- Common recursive problems: factorial, binary search, string permutations, tree traversal
    
- Recursion inefficiency vs. iterative alternatives
    

### Sorting

- Algorithm selection criteria: data size, memory, stability
    
- Selection sort: O(n²), few swaps
    
- Insertion sort: O(n) best case, O(n²) worst case
    
- Quicksort: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case (bad pivot)
    
- Merge sort: O(n log n), stable, external sorting
    
- Heap sort (via heaps)
    
- Sorting problems: merging sorted lists, algorithm trade-offs

## Applied Knowledge

### Databases

- Relational DB fundamentals: tables, rows, columns, schema
    
- Primary keys, foreign keys, referential integrity
    
- SQL basics: INSERT, SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, aggregates
    
- Inner vs. outer joins
    
- Transactions and consistency
    
- NoSQL overview: object databases, key-value/column databases
    
- Trade-offs: scalability vs. flexibility
    

### Data Science, Random Numbers, and Statistics

- Probability basics (discrete vs. continuous outcomes)
    
- Distributions: uniform, Gaussian, binomial
    
- Mean, variance, standard deviation
    
- Descriptive vs. inferential statistics
    
- Confidence intervals and sampling error
    
- Statistical tests: null hypothesis, p-values, significance
    
- Machine learning overview (supervised, unsupervised, deep learning)
    
- Random number generators (uses in simulation, ML, games)

## Problem-Solving and Puzzles

### Counting, Measuring, and Ordering Puzzles

- Brainteaser strategies: beware of assumptions
    
- Simplify, break down, use examples
    
- Open vs. closed lockers problem (perfect squares insight)
    
- Estimation problems (e.g., number of piano tuners in US)
    
- Strategies: enumerate options, avoid obvious wrong answers
    
- Interview impression: show reasoning, not just answers
