### _Abstract_

In recent years, increasing the level of autonomy that underwater vehicles are capable of operating on their own has become a crucial component in order to cope with the highly dangerous and alien environment of the ocean. This is because the ocean is a totally different environment from land. This is due to the fact that the environment of the ocean is unfamiliar as well as lethal. Nowadays, autonomous underwater vehicles, also known as AUVs, are largely chosen over remotely operated vehicles, also known as ROVs, for the majority of the jobs that need engagement with the underwater environment. This is done to prevent the operators from becoming exhausted and to increase the likelihood that they will remain safe. Research on ocean resources, oceanographic mapping, inspections of deep-sea pipelines, and other activities of a similar kind made up the majority of the work linked with underwater intervention. In these kinds of applications, having precise control over an AUV’s location of the greatest importance if one wishes to gather data of the best possible quality. This is because the precision with which the AUV maintains its station and records its location is a crucial role in influencing the quality of the data that are acquired. This is the reason why this is the case. On the other hand, achieving precise trajectory tracking control of an AUV is an extremely challenging task. This is owing to the unstructured nature of the undersea environment as well as the fact that vehicle dynamics is extremely nonlinear, coupled, and time-varying. Additionally, this is a result of the fact that the vehicle is moving. In addition to these, changes in the hydrodynamic coefficients, which are induced by changing operating conditions and vehicle, may be vulnerable to unknown variables such as ocean currents, which make the design of the trajectory tracking control much more difficult. Changes in the hydrodynamic coefficients are induced by changing operating conditions and vehicle. Because of this, it is of utmost importance to have a tracking control system for an AUV that is built to accommodate the unpredictability of the marine environment. In order to carry out nontrivial autonomous operations in the deep sea, specifically those that are in regions that are inaccessible to humans, it is necessary to have a manipulator arm that is affixed to the underwater vehicle. The issue is made more complex to tackle as a result of these elements working together. As a direct result of the connected manipulator arm, the auxiliary undersea vehicle maintenance system (AUVMS) transforms into a structurally redundant example of kinematic redundancy. As a direct result of this, it is necessary to put into action various strategies for the resolution of redundancy. The task space-based control scheme design ideas have been offered as a possible remedy to the issue of redundancy resolution as part of the scope of this research project.

## 10.1 Introduction

Due to India’s strategic location and the abundant resources that can be found in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) \[[1](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref1)\], it just so happens that the IOR is distinguished by littoral waters that are rather shallow in addition to weather patterns that are typical of tropical regions. Under these conditions, any fleet that tried to operate would have a tough time making an early discovery of the adversary, which would result in a delay in the deployment of operational troops \[[2](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref2)\]. It is estimated that 37% of the population of the globe lives within 100 km of the shore. We have a tendency to ignore the ocean in favor of paying attention to problems that occur on land and in the atmosphere; as a result, we have not been able to explore the ocean’s entire depths and discover all of the living and non-living resources that it contains. This is because we tend to ignore the ocean in favor of paying attention to problems that occur on land. It is vitally crucial to make use of underwater robots in order to get a greater understanding of marine and other environmental concerns, as well as to protect ocean resources from the consequences of pollution. Robots that are able to function submerged in water are referred to as autonomous underwater vehicles or AUVs for short.

AUVs are a crucial part of India’s robotic warfare doctrine and play a major role in the country’s Navy’s preparations for early operational deployment. In addition, AUVs are an important part of India’s overall defense industry.

The term “unmanned underwater vehicles,” of which AUVs are a subset, is used to refer to a broader category of underwater systems. It is possible to preprogram it so that it can carry out responsibilities of precise navigation, control, and direction. This is something that can be done. During the 1970s, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was the driving force behind the creation of a number of the first AUVs. One of these may be seen on display in the Hart Nautical Gallery at the MIT.

This is something that has been happening for the purpose of investigating the ocean’s resources. The value of these underwater vehicles has been shown by their ability to effectively do challenging underwater activities, in particular those that are inaccessible to human beings. The surveying and tracking of deep-sea pipelines, the creation of oceanographic maps, the investigation and monitoring of shipwrecks, and other similar activities are some examples of these duties \[[3](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref3)\]. For the aim of conducting autonomous underwater manipulation activities, these days, AUVs are often preferred over remotely operated vehicles, also known as ROVs \[[4](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref4)\]. This is because the data that are acquired will be used to inform future decisions. This is due to the fact that the efficacy of the station-keeping and position-tracking done by the AUV is a major factor in determining the quality of the data that are obtained \[[3](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref3), [5](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref5)\]. Nevertheless, accurate trajectory tracking control of underwater robots is a very difficult task to accomplish due to the unstructured nature of the underwater environment and highly nonlinear coupled vehicle dynamics that are subject to time-varying behavior \[[6](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref6)\]. This makes the task an extremely challenging one to complete. As a result, completing the assignment will be an extremely challenging endeavor.

As a consequence of this, it is highly suggested that an AUV-tracking control system be used that is outfitted with the adaptability necessary to accommodate the unpredictability of the aquatic environment. Over the course of a considerable amount of time, a number of different researchers have put up the idea of developing a variety of cutting-edge control systems for AUVs.

## 10.2 Literature Review

This section offers a condensed analysis of the research that has been conducted on the use of motion control in AUVs for a wide range of underwater manipulation tasks. The literature review is not intended to be thorough; nonetheless, it does include the bulk of the sources that inspired or directly link to the innovative results that are offered in this research. The objective of the literature review is not to be exhaustive. Because of the study that has been conducted on the difficulties associated with AUV control, a variety of alternative control strategies have been published throughout the course of some time. These strategies have been proposed at various points.

It is also one of the most effective control techniques. To begin, Jalving _et al._ \[7–14\] designed the sliding mode control (SMC) in order to provide reliable trajectory tracking control for underwater vehicles \[[15](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref15)\]. This was done so that they could conduct research. This was accomplished with the help of the SMC. Later in the year 1991, Yoerger _et al._ \[[16](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref16)\] investigate the possibility of using adaptive SMC to the experimental underwater vehicle in some capacity. They accomplish this within the framework of the year 1991. In addition to this, Cristi _et al._ \[[17](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref17)\] described an adaptable SMC that may be used with AUVs when they are in the dive plane. Rodrigues _et al._ \[18–20\] describe the development of higher-order sliding modes for diving control of a torpedo AUV. The goal of this work was to improve the functionality of classical SMC. This was done with the intention of improving the performance of standard SMC. Extensive study on the control and coordination of a large number of autonomous vehicles operating in the horizontal plane can be found in Liu _et al._ \[[21](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref21)\], which makes use of the finite-time optimal formation control technique as the major control strategy. Despite this, most of the aforementioned controllers need some amount of expertise with hydrodynamics and disturbances in order to effectively create a control scheme. This familiarity might be comprehensive or partial, depending on the situation. In addition, owing to the manner in which it is implemented, the SMC-based control method is susceptible to the chattering problem. This problem might be fixed by replacing the discontinuous term sgn() with an approximation that uses a continuous function, such as the hyperbolic tangent function or one of the many other examples that could be used \[[22](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref22)\]. Increasing the order of the sliding surface may also be helpful in preventing chattering, as shown in Joe _et al._ \[[23](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref23)\], which describes an experiment in which this tactic was put to the test and found to be successful. In addition, the use of a time-delay controller, which has been successfully applied to the tracking control of AUV and is advocated in Kim _et al_. and Kumar _et al_. \[[3](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref3), [24](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref24)\], may significantly cut down on the amount of chattering that occurs.

Intelligent control strategies, including fuzzy logic and neural network control, have seen widespread use in the operation and management of robotic systems \[[25](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref25), [26](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref26)\]. \[Note: These strategies provide a different solution to the problem of overcoming the limitations of the robust control methods that were covered earlier in the article. These intelligent control strategies have shown to be useful when applied to the management of underwater vehicles \[27–31\]. Yuh \[[32](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref32)\] was the first person to propose the use of a neural network (NN) as a control mechanism for an AUV. There are several iterations of the NN, including the one-layer NN \[[28](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref28)\], the feed-forward NN \[[33](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref33)\], and the adaptive NN \[34–36\]. Fuzzy control of AUVs is another topic that has received a significant amount of research \[37–39\]. Choi _et al._ \[[40](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref40)\] came up with the concept for a fuzzy controller that was computationally more efficient and that only took in one input variable at a time. Ishaque _et al._ \[[41](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref41)\] came up with a single-input fuzzy controller that has a piecewise linear control surface in 2011. This controller was designed for the purpose of managing the depth of an AUV \[[41](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref41)\]. However, research into the robustness and stability of these intelligent control systems has demonstrated to be exceedingly arduous and difficult to evaluate \[[42](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref42)\].

The integration of soft-computing tactics such as fuzzy logic computing (FLC) and support vector machine control has emerged as one of the most promising control approaches in recent years. This is as a result of the fact that it guarantees stability and has a high degree of resilience in the face of perturbations in the parameters \[[42](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref42), [43](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref43)\].

The following is a list of the key strengths that the fuzzy sliding mode control (FSMC) possesses: (1) Because the fuzzy inference system offers a qualitative interpretation, having an in-depth knowledge of the system model is not required to use it. This is due to the fact that the system gives a qualitative interpretation. (2) The fuzzy control rules \[[44](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref44)\] may be developed in a straightforward manner by using the principles of sliding mode, which not only ensures the system’s stability and resilience but also makes the process of developing the rules reasonably straightforward. As a consequence of this, FSMC has experienced a significant uptick in use over the last several years in terms of the control of underwater robots. In the beginning, \[[45](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref45)\] recommended employing sliding mode fuzzy controllers for the heading and pitch control of an AUV in order to obtain time optimum control performance. This was done in order to acquire the best possible control performance \[[46](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref46)–[53](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref53)\]. On the other hand, the bulk of the controllers that were covered before use decoupled control approaches and a lower-order mathematical model of an AUV, but they ignore the cross-coupling features of the system. An AUV, on the other hand, has to be controlled with a respectable level of accuracy across all six degrees of freedom if it is to be capable of engaging in interactive activities while submerged in water. The attempts that are made in \[[3](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref3), [54](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref54)–[58](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref58)\] are few and far between.

Over the course of some time, a variety of distinct algorithms have been proposed as possible answers to the problem of redundancy resolution \[[59](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref59)–[66](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref66)\]. These algorithms have been put up as possibilities. An additional possibility is that the control rule might be developed inside the body-fixed reference frame in order to accomplish the same goals as the control action. In addition, there is a diverse amount of work that must be completed by auxiliary undersea vehicle maintenance system (AUVMS) in order to achieve more than one objective. Consider the fact that the AUVMS must perform end-effector position tracking as its main aim and obstacle avoidance as its secondary purpose, as an example. It is necessary for it to do both of these jobs. Control strategies that are based on configuration space or on a body-fixed reference frame are not acceptable in these sorts of conditions \[[67](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref67)\]. In contrast to this, the control that is based on the task space does not call for any inverse kinematic solutions. Because of this, it is possible that it is the option that is most suitable to be chosen. In addition, it is desirable to manage the task space when it is essential to make frequent online modifications to the space of the end-job effector \[[67](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref67)\]. The use of a feedback loop that instantly lowers task space mistakes without the need for any explicit calculation of inverse kinematics is the key advantage that can be gained by using a method that is based on the concept of task space. Because of this, carrying out such calculations is no longer necessary. There have not been a lot of effort put into going in this specific route \[[68](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref68), [69](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref69)\].

## 10.3 Control Problem in AUV Control System

The motion control of AUVs has proven to be such a difficult endeavor for a variety of reasons, some of which are stated below; yet, this has not stopped researchers from trying.

Higher-order and redundant structure when the manipulator is connected; • environmental disturbances caused by ocean currents, wind-driven waves, and other factors of a nature similar to those mentioned previously.

In the event that the system of an autonomous underwater robot is unable to work as planned, the ocean’s unstructured and potentially dangerous environment poses a number of difficult barriers to overcome. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to have a dependable and specialized vehicle control system that is outfitted with the capability of auto-tuning in the event that the control performance suffers while the robot is in operation as a result of shifts in the dynamics of both the robot and the environment. This is because shifts in the dynamics of both the robot and the environment can cause the control performance to suffer. This is due to the fact that changes in these dynamics might result in a decrease in the control performance.

One of the most promising and efficient nonlinear robust control systems is the classical sliding mode control, which is also known as CSMC. The ease with which it can be developed, as well as the fact that it is invariant to external disturbances and uncertainties, makes the CSMC one of the most effective nonlinear control systems. On the other hand, in order to construct a control system making use of SMC, one has to possess precise information about the system that is being controlled. However, in order to construct the control system, this sort of information must be gathered even if it is not truly available in practice. In a scenario such as this one, having access to an intelligent control method like FLC would be a more helpful tool to have at one’s disposal than any other option. It is probable that the capacity of FLC to be applied to plants that are not so clearly characterized mathematically is the single most important and defining element of FLC.

On the other hand, verifying the stability of a control system that is based on fuzzy logic is a job that is difficult and demanding. Integrating SMC and FLC might very well be the solution to this problem, since it offers the opportunity of resolving it. Because it overcomes the weaknesses of one technique in favor of another, this fusion approach is fast becoming the most promising kind of control because it enables the development of certain stability and powerful control performance. In addition, this method is rapidly evolving into the form of control that has the most potential. Despite this, there are a few obstacles, issues, and constraints that need to be taken into consideration in order to be fully understood. The following is a rundown of the order in which they will be delivered to you:

-   The discontinuous control component of the SMC is the root of an annoying chattering that may be heard in the control torques. Because of this chattering, there is an increased possibility that the actuators of an AUV may wear out before their time.
-   The sliding mode cannot be put into practice unless it is first feasible to determine the limits of the uncertainty and disruptions that are now present. This is an impossibility. On the other hand, it is not actually feasible to discover it in the vast majority of instances; therefore, finding it is not something that can be done.
-   An asymptotic representation of the convergence of the position tracking errors may be obtained _via_ the use of the generic form of the position tracking errors. As a consequence of this, the target of establishing stability in a certain length of time is one that cannot realistically be attained.
-   It is not possible to obtain accurate values for these hydrodynamic coefficients, since the values of these coefficients fluctuate depending on the operating circumstances. This makes it impossible to calculate accurate values for these hydrodynamic coefficients. Because of this, it is not possible to collect correct information on the dynamics of an AUV for the purpose of building the control system for the vehicle.
-   The traditional FLC includes components such as a rule-base storage area, an inference mechanism, fuzzification, and defuzzification procedures in its arsenal of tools. However, due to the fact that there are a range of technical challenges that need to be addressed, it is possible that this is not acceptable for use in applications of AUVs that are put into practical use. Some of the problems that need to be addressed include the lack of real-time response, inadequate communication bandwidth, inadequate processing capability, and inadequate onboard battery life.
-   There is not currently a standardized approach that can be used in real-world applications of autonomous underwater vehicles to find fuzzy control rules that are appropriate for the design of an FLC (AUVs).
-   The design of a disturbance observer, which is the most typical need of observer design in the case of underwater vehicles, frequently requires high-precision accelerators, but these accelerators are not always accessible. This is a challenge because the design of a disturbance observer is the most typical need of observer design in the case of underwater vehicles. This is a problem due to the fact that the design of a disturbance observer is a necessity for observer design that occurs most often in the context of underwater vehicles.

The AUVMS has become a kinematically redundant structure ever since it was outfitted with an attached manipulator arm. This has been the case since the attachment of the arm. In order to find a solution to this issue, it is required to put into practice resolutions for issues with duplication.

The primary objective of this thesis is to develop stable and intelligent control algorithms for the purpose of maneuvering control of an AUV in the presence of an unstructured oceanic environment. This will be accomplished in order to fulfill the purpose of the thesis. In order to do this and have the thesis serve its intended function, this will be done. Ocean currents and waves are the unidentified external factors that are responsible for creating this environment’s turbulent conditions. In addition, the hydrodynamic coefficients themselves come with their own set of inherent uncertainties: (1) the invention of a trustworthy technique of control that is based on SMC and all of its variations, which is necessary for the deployment of this astute and dependable method of control; (2) the execution of this trustworthy method of control.

Create a method for SMC control that is based on an uncertainty estimate; Develop effective control strategies by using FLC and forward-thinking control algorithms;

Develop a dependable higher-order SMC that can achieve high levels of tracking precision;

Conceive a method of intelligent control with increased robustness, one that combines SMC and FLC.

Develop a sturdy higher-order SMC that is capable of providing accurate tracking control. The following technique will be used for the whole research in order to successfully satisfy the control goals that were outlined earlier.

The mathematical pillars that the control rule is built upon to support its operation. The Lyapunov approach was used in the creation of the stability research as well as the confirmation of the suggested control plan. Investigating the simulation environment in great detail and making careful assessments of the results. Conducting an analysis of the proposed procedures in light of the standard control standards in order to ascertain whether or not these procedures are reliable and productive. In the following lines, you will find a condensed version of a few of the most significant contributions that were produced in the course of this study.

## 10.4 Methodology

An SMC-based robust control method for position trajectory tracking control of a 6-DOF nonlinear AUV model is created and utilized in this study. SMC with PID sliding surface-based control design is able to overcome the steady state error that is often caused by traditional SMC, which is based on the boundary layer.

![[attachments/eqpg217-1.png]]

Since this SMC design makes use of linear sliding hyperplanes, it is able to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the system even while it is functioning in sliding mode. This is made possible by the fact that linear sliding hyperplanes are used. Because of this, the tracking errors will finally reach the equilibrium point after an unspecified period of time has elapsed. This is a direct result of the situation. One may achieve limited time convergence, also known as terminal sliding mode (TSM), by including a nonlinear element into a conventionally linear sliding surface. This allows for the possibility of achieving TSM. The decoupled equation for forward motion can be written as follows:

![[attachments/eqpg218-1.png]]

where _t_<sub>1</sub> is the control force due to propeller in surge direction, and the linear surge model at a given operating speed _u_<sub>0</sub> is given as follows:

![[attachments/eqpg218-2.png]]

The thrust force is calculated as a function of propeller rpm and vessel speed by performing systematic runs in the towing tank with free running self-propelled forward speed tests. The decoupled motion in sway and yaw linearized about the constant speed can be represented as follows:

![[attachments/eqpg218-3.png]]

where

![[attachments/eqpg218-4.png]]

On the other hand, there is a worry over singularities in the TSM design techniques. As a direct consequence of this, a non-singular TSM control, also referred to as NTSMC, has been proposed in order to achieve control devoid of singularity. A complete nonlinear 6-DOF AUV model has been positioned using this control, which has also been utilized for other controls. The NTSMC strategy that has been presented is evaluated for its usefulness by using a flat-fish AUV in a numerical simulation and putting it through a number of uncertain operating scenarios. This helps determine how effective the strategy is. In addition, a disturbance estimator based on non-singular fast TSMC (NFTSMC) is proposed for the purpose of position trajectory tracking of an AUVMS in task space coordinates. The use of a disturbance estimator to get an online estimate of lumped disturbances while the estimator is working on an AUVMS is a contributor to the greater robustness given by the approach that was recommended. In addition, the technique enables high-precision control in addition to quick error convergence without the need for any prior knowledge on the uncertainty bounds. Taking into account a planar AUVMS for the purpose of carrying out sophisticated underwater operations helps to demonstrate mathematically that the proposed robust NFTSMC has the potential to be implemented successfully.

![[attachments/eqpg219-1.png]]

Because it is a technique that does not need a model, the FLC is one of the most powerful tools because it can be used to design a controller with just a partial knowledge of the system. This makes it one of the most practical tools. An easier method to build a standard fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is developed, and it is given the name resilient PD-like Fuzzy Controller (PD-FZ). This method is developed independently for an unmanned aerial vehicle’s diving and steering subsystems. Then, this system is put to use for combined activities including directing, diving, and controlling the pace. In order to produce fuzzy control rules for a controlled process, the behavior of a controlled process that displays the PD type control characteristics is analyzed. This is done in order to regulate the behavior of the controlled process.

![[attachments/eqpg219-2.png]]

Waypoint acquisition, which is driven by a line of sight, is the procedure that allows for path tracking to be completed successfully. The simulation of the Naval Postgraduate Schools’ (NPS) AUV II operating in a number of different types of environmental disturbances is currently being run in order to test the effectiveness of the control method that has been provided. This test is being carried out in order to ensure that the simulation is accurate. In addition to this, it has been proposed that a robust task space control technique may be used. This strategy would be based on a nonlinear PID-like FLC approach. The bulk of the recommended control strategy is composed of a feed forward term, in addition to a disturbance estimator and a PID-like FLC law. The suggested control strategy is essentially split up into two different components. The recommended approach provides the answer to the problem of task space position trajectory tracking control that an AUVMS must deal with in the context of underwater manipulation task applications.

![[attachments/eqpg220-1.png]]

In order to guarantee the successful application of a nonlinear PID-like FLC strategy, a simplified version that is referred to as single-input FLC (SIFLC) is offered. This version is based on the concept of signed distance method. This particular version of FLC is what is known as a simplified version of the program. In the task space coordinate system, a robust SIFLC, sometimes referred to as an RSIFLC, is designed and implemented in order to accommodate planar AUVMS. This is done in order to make the system more resilient so that it can be enhanced. Because of its simple control structure and design approach, the RSIFLC that was shown is suitable for real-time implementation using a microprocessor that can be purchased at a lower cost.

## 10.5 Results

Not only does the combination of FSMC and SMC gives great resistance against changes in the values of hydrodynamic parameter, but it also ensures the stability of the system. The acronym FSMC is derived from the combining of SMC and FLC from [Figures 10.1](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#fig10-1) to [10.5](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#fig10-5) represents the output images of proposed work.

In addition, the “chattering” in the control input that is created by conventional SMC has been completely eradicated as a result of the use of the fuzzy approach. This has occurred because of the traditional SMC. Making use of the sliding mode concept makes it feasible to create the fuzzy control rules in a simple way \[[45](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref45)\]. An adaptive variant of sliding mode control, also known as AFSMC for its acronym in full, is recommended for use in the maneuvering control of an autonomous aerial vehicle (AUV) \[[25](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref25)\] that is capable of motion in six different degrees of freedom (DOF). This adjustable mechanism increases the closed-loop system’s stability by allowing for the fuzzy consequent parameters of the FLC to be modified.

When using the FSMC technique, making use of a terminal sliding surface allows one to achieve convergence in a limited amount of time and in a short amount of time. As a consequence of this, a non-singular fast fuzzy TSMC (NFFTSMC) in conjunction with a disturbance estimator is provided for the purpose of use in the position tracking control of an AUV. An FLC tool is employed whenever there is a need to reduce the amount of chattering that occurs in the control inputs. Dynamic simulation studies have been used to test the viability of the proposed AFSMC and NFFTSMC systems. These studies have been conducted in conditions that are unanticipated, which demonstrates that the viability of these systems can be verified.

It is advised to utilize a chatter-free second-order TSMC for the purpose of position monitoring an AUV that is aligned to a falling aircraft. This is done in order to get the desired results. A sliding surface that is incorporated into the design of the controller is used so that there will be no reaching phase when the controller is used. On the other hand, due to the fact that it serves a sign function, it is plagued by the chattering effect. A linear integral manifold and a non-singular terminal sliding manifold are coupled together in order to carry out the steps necessary to construct the sliding manifold controller (SMC) of the second order. This is done to lessen the amount of chattering that occurs in the control input.

The use of TSM inside the proposed method makes it possible to guarantee the finite-time stability of the closed-loop system. It has been determined that the simulation goals for the depth position control of the DSRV AUV have been met. In addition to this, a nonlinear disturbance observer-based Second-order terminal sliding mode (SONTSMC) (NDO-SONTSMC) is proposed to monitor a predefined task space trajectory of an AUVMS. This is an extension of what was discussed before.

This is done as an extension to what was discussed before. Effectively estimating the aggregated degree of uncertainty is the suggested NDO phrase that does not include any measurements of acceleration.

Both robustness and tracking accuracy have seen significant improvements as a direct result of the integration of NDO with SONTSMC. The effectiveness of the controller is proven with the aid of numerical simulations carried out on a planar variety of AUVMS undergoing motion in the horizontal plane.
