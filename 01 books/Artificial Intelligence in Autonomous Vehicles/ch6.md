### _Abstract_

Modern technology is becoming more prevalent in all procedures to enhance the standard of people’s lives. As they advance in the healthcare industry, advanced technologies have paved the path for all industries over time. The use of technology in healthcare is growing involvement in nearly all activities from practically showing up on the screen for lab testing. Many individuals live in isolated places, those are lacking access to basic healthcare, making it accessible through pharmaceuticals, vaccinations, blood, and sample collection for analysis. Drones are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Common uses for this approach include situations where deploying a human-piloted aircraft poses a significant danger or when it is not practicable to use human planes. A drone can quickly bring medicines, supplies, and vaccinations to the location where they are needed, ending the outsourcing of deadly infectious illnesses. A drone may be employed for both disaster relief and administration. A live video feed of the impacted areas can be provided. There are a few spots in India that are difficult to get to owing to hazardous pathways and others that have dense traffic or subpar transportation infrastructure, but for some operations, a drone is seen to be enough. Consumers and the health-care system are benefiting from a new perspective brought about by drones. The primary drivers of drone adoption will be advances in technology, rising investment, and assistance from the government. In a similar vein, these variables are also anticipated to increase the distribution of healthcare goods and services in rural regions. It has several potential advantages and can act as a pillar of support for the current healthcare system. The COVID-19 epidemic has propelled medical drone development and utilization over the last 2 years.

## 6.1 Introduction

Today, a medical professional may virtually appear on a computer, make a sound diagnosis, and provide sound counsel after evaluating the data. Distance no longer has any value. Actually, geography has morphed into history! Making medications, vaccinations, blood, or even biological samples for research available in genuinely distant places is a huge challenge. In order to reach the unreachable and make isolation relative rather than absolute, drones are being employed more and more in healthcare today. The term “inaccessible” itself will eventually lose its meaning. The reader is introduced to yet another instance of possible creative disruption in the healthcare industry in this overview. The author is certain that this will soon occur in several rural areas of India.

We are currently experiencing a technological revolution. Healthcare professionals throughout the world are notoriously conservative though. In a recent analysis, Goldman Sachs predicted that over the next 5 years, the world will spend over $100 billion on drones. The military has made substantial use of drones in battle. The majority of drone uses include employing an onboard camera for surveillance. The different use cases include surveillance in agriculture; crop spraying; surveillance of sharks at beaches; wildlife conservation monitoring; fire monitoring; riot monitoring by police and governments; media coverage of events, sports, and entertainment and entertainment news; emergency services disaster responses for humanitarian aid; and scientific research and exploration \[[1](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref1), [2](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref2)\].

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is another name for drones. The phrase “autonomous, or remotely operated, multi-use aerial vehicles” was originally used in the 1980s. UAV technology’s speed and adaptability provide essentially limitless potential for delivering aid and medical supplies to people in isolated or dangerous locations. They can even more quickly connect patients with doctors. Bystanders who are given remote instructions on how to deliver treatment to victims of emergencies or natural disasters may be able to save lives \[[3](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref3)\].

Drones may cease to operate due to bad weather or variations in the environment’s temperature. Drone construction and maintenance costs need to be thoroughly examined in order to do a cost–benefit analysis.

### 6.1.1 Role of Artificial Intelligence in Drone Technology

Unmanned aerial vehicles called drones are used for a range of different tasks. These types of gadgets were first controlled manually and remotely. But nowadays, artificial intelligence is frequently included into drones, automating some or all tasks. Drone suppliers can gather and exploit visual type of data and environmental data by using data from sensors attached to the drone in combination with AI \[[4](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref4), [5](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref5)\].

By enabling autonomous or aided flying, these data increase accessibility and facilitate operation. Drones are now commercially available to companies and individuals as a part of the smart mobility services. Drones powered by artificial intelligence (AI) mostly rely on computer vision. Drones can now identify items while in the air and analyze and record data on the ground with the use of AI technology. High-performance onboard image processing using a neural network is how computer vision functions. A layered architecture known as a neural network is what machine learning algorithms are implemented using. Drones can realize, classify, and trace objects with the help of neural networks \[[6](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref6)\]. Drones can find and track objects while avoiding collisions because of the real-time combination of these data.

Researchers must first teach the machine learning techniques to detect and precisely classify things in a range of scenarios before using neural networks in drones. This is done by giving the algorithm specifically labeled photographs. These pictures show the neural network what characteristics distinct item classes have and how to recognize one object type from another. Advanced neural networks operate autonomously and keep learning while in use, getting better at detection and processing \[[7](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref7)\].

Programming a drone to create it is different from programming it to carry out certain tasks. In order to have a drone fly steadily, sensors, actuators, and some sort of CPU must be interfaced. However, all that is required to create an application is a computer that can run algorithms and a drone that is easily accessible. It depends on the gear used to make the drone if the inquiry is about building one. If the Arduino-based controllers are utilized as an illustration, more embedded systems are involved. In order for the controller to interpret sensor data and deliver control signals to actuators in order to create a steady flight, communication between the microcontroller and all other sensors must be established \[[8](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref8), [9](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref9)\].

### 6.1.2 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle—Drone Technology

Due to their low cost and widespread use, UAVs, sometimes known as drones, are now a part of our daily lives. In addition to legal and ethical concerns, drone technology is still developing, and many industries are looking into using drones as a replacement to improve difficult operations and save operational costs. Agriculture, gas detection and mapping, delivering medical supplies, search and rescue operations, surveillance, humanitarian aid, and pest and disease control, to name a few, are just a few of the many applications and services that have been proposed. Although drones are a complex assemblage of hardware devices, each one is controlled by a microprocessor with auxiliary sensors that may be integrated into or external to the microprocessor board. Each drone has its own specifications, technical details, and firmware. The technical word for this piece of hardware, flight controller (FC), will be used to refer to these technical features going forward because they are outside the focus of this essay. Each of the necessary flying components that make up the drone system will be essential to its safe functioning. [Figure 6.1](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#fig6-1) shows the architecture’s composition; the sections that follow provide further information on each component \[[10](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref10), [11](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref11)\].

-   The drone’s primary communication bus is supported by the drone broker. Additionally, the system contains a relay mechanism that is in charge of directly relaying messages back and forth with the ground systems.
-   To process and examine the drone’s activity, the flight analyzer connects to flight telemetry data. This system may identify abnormalities to actively alert the ground system and attempt to resolve the problem using pattern identification and behavior profiling. It can activate fail-safe systems as a final resort.
-   When activated, the fail-safe system is a device that works to lessen the effects of a failure. These can be quite simple, such as stopping takeoff or requiring a safe landing when a low battery level is detected \[[12](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref12)\].
-   The drone logger connects to the necessary broker channels or topics to make a local copy of all drone-related events for registry and debugging reasons. The drone controller, represented by a code file, serves as an adapter design pattern, converting broker command messages into messages that are readable by the FC and distancing the platform from the technical requirements necessary to effectively communicate with the FC.
-   The drone controller, which is represented by a code file, serves as an adapter design pattern, converting broker command messages into communications that are readable by the FC and shielding the platforms from the technical requirements needed to effectively communicate with the FC.
-   In order to accurately represent the command end-point and the inner drones’ remote monitoring (altitude, temperature levels, pressure sensor, motion sensor, velocities, voltage and battery voltages, GPS) various data generator, the FC does have the duty of monitoring the flying drone procedures and correcting its behavior.
-   The drone mapper is an expansion of the drones’ real geofencing capabilities. It offers dynamic map loading based on recent GPS data and a specified radius in direct contact with its second half, the ground mapper. Additionally, it is able to offer more detailed information, such as constraints on the minimum and maximum height that are typical of metropolitan environments.

## 6.2 Kinds of Drones Used by Medical Professionals

Contrary to what its name would imply, a medical drone is no different from any other commercial drone. In other words, these are the same kinds of crafts you would find in the transportation and utility sectors \[[13](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref13), [14](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref14)\].

Typically, medical IT teams add cameras, sensors, and lights to drones to meet specialized navigation, data gathering, and communication requirements. In the end, there are a variety of drone kinds, each of which is better suited for particular use scenarios \[[15](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref15), [16](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref16)\].

### 6.2.1 Multirotor

Multiple lift-producing rotors are found in multirotor drones. They are suitable for modest medical deliveries, since they are affordable and typically have a carrying capacity of between 50 and 100 lb. These drones are also excellent for data collecting and aerial photography. For these reasons, multirotor drones are frequently used by emergency response teams to assist in rescue missions.

### 6.2.2 Only One Rotor

Single-rotor drones, as their name indicates, contain just one rotor, making them look like miniature helicopters. They can fly for longer stretches of time and are more effective than multirotor drones in terms of operation. But they are frequently also much heavier, more intricate, and more costly.

### 6.2.3 Permanent-Wing Drones

Fixed-wing drones, which resemble airplanes, and fixed-wing hybrids, which combine wings and rotors, are increasingly being used by certain medical professionals. These drones are better suited for long-distance flight.

### 6.2.4 Drones for Passenger Ambulances

A number of businesses are now testing passenger ambulance drones, which can fly patients and medical personnel from one location to another. Undoubtedly, it will take some time before these sorts of aircraft are economically viable for commercial use. But in the future, they may change how emergency medical services are provided.

## 6.3 Medical and Public Health Surveillance

Drones are utilized for disease monitoring, disaster site surveillance, and places with biological and chemical risks. In high-risk situations, it has been demonstrated that drones can gather data on how many patients are in need of treatment and prioritize. Drones were deployed in the Philippines during Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 to offer overhead surveillance, assess initial storm damage, and prioritize relief operations. The National Health Service (NHS) in England has looked into the utilization of drones to evaluate injuries connected to biological, chemical, and radioactive hazards in an effort to increase the effectiveness of response teams \[[19](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref19), [23](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref23)\].

Drone technology has been used to identify radiation, aerosols, and heavy metals as potential health risks. Drones outfitted with high-resolution photogrammetry tools were utilized in a research from southern Italy to precisely assess and forecast the cancer risk associated with high levels of copper content in agricultural regions which has the capacity to precisely detect aerosol and trace gas concentrations in challenging terrain using a quadrotor drone with an integrated sampling platform. This technology can stop the spread of pathogen-caused health risks through early identification. Along the same lines, drone technology has also been used to map radiation from uranium mines and detect radionuclides that are characteristic in nuclear accidents \[[25](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref25), [26](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref26)\].

Drones are also a promising option for epidemiological research because of their affordability and real-time high-precision temporal and geographical data acquisition capabilities. Tracking of deforestation, increased agricultural production, and many other activities that affect biological populations and natural ecosystems are examples of such an application. In Malaysia, altering land use and deforestation patterns that affect the zoonotic transmission of malarial parasites were characterized using drones by Fornace _et al._ \[[29](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref29)\]. In a different example study, Barasona _et al._ \[[28](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref28)\] tracked the geographic spread of big animals in southern Spain that carried TB using drones. _Staphylococcus aureus_ and the Ebola virus have recently been found by researchers using drones equipped with nucleic acid analysis modules.

### 6.3.1 Telemedicine

Drone applications in the developing field of telemedicine, which involves treating patients remotely _via_ communications technology, are among the most promising \[[35](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref35)\]. Telecommunications is the important term in the concept of telemedicine. Unfortunately, commercial networks cannot provide the essential connectivity for telemedicine operation in distant disaster-relief and war areas. The senior author (JCR) spoke about the concept of creating instant telecommunication infrastructure (ITI) utilizing drones in 1998 in Athens, Greece, at the Yale/NASA Commercial Space Center Telemedicine Program \[[27](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref27), [28](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref28)\].

[Figure 6.2](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#fig6-2) displays the drone’s medicine distribution process in a region affected by an epidemic. A purchase order is placed for the region’s urgently required medical supplies. The delivery point’s GPS coordinates are made publicly. The necessary medicine is carried by the drone. A single pill of a malaria medication is fastened to the drone for display reasons. The operator’s primary duty is to control the drone’s navigation; hence, there is no programming code used in this process. The drone was piloted in a wide open area with enough room to avoid hitting any people or buildings. The drone was lowered to the ground after it arrived at the delivery location \[[29](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref29)\].

A drone platform that specializes in delivering communications for preoperative and postoperative patient assessments and telementoring of some important surgical and clinical procedures in remote locations was carried out with the use of medical drones. With new procedures utilizing computers and telecommunications, telementoring means providing remote assistance by a highly experienced surgeon or a special proceduralist to a less experienced coworker. With the onboard camera, the receiver was captured in a photograph. The medicine was taken by the receiver. The drone was then returned to the base in flight \[[36](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref36)\].

### 6.3.2 Drones as Medical Transportation Devices

Drones are an appealing medical delivery tool due to their quick reaction times and ability to cross otherwise impenetrable terrain. The findings revealed that drones can aid in medical decision-making by providing quick diagnoses \[[37](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref37)\]. Drones or UAVs have been introduced globally as a result of the rapid growth of technology to promote mobility over difficult geographic boundaries, reduce carbon emissions, and maybe even raise the cost-effectiveness of healthcare delivery. The time consumption is 25% less when compared to road transport \[[30](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref30)\].

Given the inherent requirement for a quick reaction to improve patient outcomes, the use of drones in emergency care is particularly intriguing. Drone use is especially well suited for quick distribution of medical supplies and medications to patients for self-administering \[[24](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref24)\]. Aerial camera use can also help with rapid evaluation and improve prompt emergency responses. Drones, for instance, can speed up patient assessment and treatment initiation compared to ambulance response alone. Patients in locations with historically lengthy Emergency Medical Services (EMS) response times might particularly benefit from this application \[[17](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref17)\]. In the case of a medical emergency, drones can offer a first reaction by immediately bringing the best tools on-site, mainly when every second counts \[[14](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref14)\].

Drones have also been used in emergency care to carry automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to people assisting victims in cardiac arrest. According to a simulation-based study conducted in Salt Lake County, Utah, correctly operated drones may reach 96% of the population in less than 1 min \[[31](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref31)\]. Conventional ambulance response times, on the other hand, accomplished this goal in just 4.3% of cases. Unluckily, present systems continue to be plagued by issues like high accident rates, airspace rules, and injury control \[[20](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref20)\]. As a result, further research is needed to improve their overall efficiency and overall performance \[[18](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref18)\].

The inquiry on the use of drones for patient transportation has been spearheaded by the military. The US Army Medical Research division gave a demonstration of how injured soldiers may be extracted using VTOL drones while avoiding airspace conflicts. Their paper does note, however, that there are still no clear criteria or norms covering the physiological effects of flying on patient health and safety. Unmanned air and ground vehicles were successfully employed in 2015 to react to a simulated distress call reporting a fatality in the field \[[32](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref32)\]. One individual used an Android tablet to control both unmanned devices \[[34](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref34)\].

### 6.3.3 Advanced System for First Aid for the Elderly People

There are two key components to the AFAS. The prototype fall detection device (FDD) in the first component is intended to monitor heart rate and find falls. It has a microprocessor, two biosensors for heart rate and acceleration (HB and ACC), a GPS system to track position, and a GSM system to send a message of notice to the smartphones of caretakers at a call emergency center (CEC).

The second component involves the CEC giving the patient first help, which includes giving the patient a first aid kit, a smartphone, and a UAV to deliver the kit. The smart phone or mobile phone at the CEC has two functions: it is used to plan the UAV’s flight route and to receive communications from the FDD.

![[attachments/fig6-3.jpg]]

[**Figure 6.3**](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#rfig6-3) Block diagram of first aid delivery system.

The FDD, which is linked to the patient’s upper arm and uses the FDB-HRT algorithm to execute monitoring and decision-making tasks, is the central component of the proposed AFAS. The suggested FDD would send signals to the CEC with the patient’s information once it notices a body fall and an irregular HR measurement (ID, health status, and location). This entire process is shown in block diagram ([Figure 6.3](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#fig6-3)).

Messages are sent to the caregivers in the CEC for display on the smart-phone’s LCD. As a result, the first aid kit will be created in accordance with the patient’s condition and delivered to the patient by UAV based on the message’s coordinates. Thus, it was determined that the proposed design significantly cuts down on delivery time as compared to administering first aid by ambulance. In terms of heart rate measurement precision, fall detection, information messages, and UAV arrival time, the suggested enhanced first aid system performed better than earlier systems \[[21](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref21)\].

## 6.4 Potential Benefits of Drones in the Healthcare Industry

One of the common uses of drones in healthcare is medicine and prescription delivery. These drones can be used to transfer biological specimens such as blood, plasma, and other tissues in some advanced circumstances. In rural and distant areas, accessing healthcare is extremely difficult. To address this problem, drones shall be used to transport pharmaceuticals that are unreachable by bus, truck, or train. However, the region must be fully-equipped with a good communication infrastructure. Aside from delivering pharmaceuticals, drones may deliver various biological materials. Drones are one of the greatest options for delivering critical medical equipment and medications in the event of a medical emergency. They can greatly reduce transit time and save the life of critically ill patients at the right time. One of the finest instances of emergency service is organ transfer. Likewise, in the case of cardiopulmonary arrest emergencies, drones are a better alternative than conventional modes of transportation for delivering necessary supplies \[[36](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref36)\].

Drones can also be utilized for public safety purposes, such as fighting viral illnesses. Drones can also be used to clean regions such as parks, stations, and various public places to combat illness. It may spray sanitizer in an area more accurately and efficiently without the user’s contact participation. Drones’ scope and applicability for cleaning public locations may expand in the future. Drones can also be used for contactless delivery of hazardous materials, monitoring of remote regions, and the supply of other medical supplies.

After considering these advantages and applications, drones may be beneficially used in the healthcare delivery system to improve the entire patient experience.

### 6.4.1 Top Medical Drone Delivery Services

Several firms across the world are running trial run programs and planning to commercially use drones for healthcare delivery. Zipline, Volocopter GmbH, Volansi Inc., Novant Health, Matternet, Vayu, SZ DJI Technology, Embention, Manna Drone Delivery Inc., Flirtey, Ehang, Tu Delft, Sky Sports Ltd., Project Wing, HiRO (Healthcare Integrated Rescue Operations), and others are among the market leaders. Given the market potential, numerous new firms with more creative and advanced applications are likely to enter the market in future years.

### 6.4.2 Limitations of Drones in Healthcare

The drone has several restrictions when it comes to the delivery of health-care, despite its advantageous uses. The drone’s flight may be adversely affected by technological factors such as short battery life, speed, vibration, poor load capacity, g-force, and accuracy. The utilization of drones and their performance are influenced by the frequency and availability of drone landing sites. To fly the drone, a ground pilot must maintain a constant communication channel with the vehicle. Additionally, while providing essential medicinal goods, environmental conditions like humidity, abrupt changes in pressure, and temperature must be taken into account. The quality of the medicinal supply might be impacted by unfavorable weather conditions.

Similar to this, widespread deployment of drones depends on social approval. The broad deployment may have an impact on the job market and result in unemployment. The consumer’s personal information is necessary for the delivery of the medical supply. Companies must adhere rigorously to data security and compliance to prevent security breaches. People occasionally may believe that their privacy and private property are being invaded by drones, since they are fitted with cameras. Another problem is the carriage’s high economic expense.

The development and acceptance of drone delivery systems are being hampered on the legal front by rigorous laws and regulations. There is no standardized procedure for permission or use of drones, and each country has its own set of regulations. Similar to how drones pose a serious hazard to planes, organizations using them must obtain the required authorization from aviation authorities and must adhere to certain strict regulations.

Delivery _via_ drones is still in its early stages. With a high success rate, businesses are undertaking test flights across several locations. Zipline and Rwanda’s Health Ministry have worked together to introduce the drone delivery system there. Additionally, Zipline has used drones to carry personal protection equipment to medical facilities in North Carolina. The business is also looking at the possibility in other nations. Merck and Volansi, a drone company, have teamed up to send “cold-chain” medications to isolated areas of North Carolina. In the fight against COVID-19, a UK-based firm called Skyports is helping the NHS and carrying out hospital-to-hospital medical supplies. Along with these, a number of other businesses are looking into the utilization of drones in the area of health-care delivery \[[22](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref22), [33](https://learning-oreilly-com.ezproxy.christchurchcitylibraries.com/library/view/artificial-intelligence-for/9781119847465/c01.xhtml#ref33)\].

The delivery of healthcare might undergo a change in the next few years as a result of the use of drones and cutting-edge technology like telehealth. However, the government must set clear criteria while making sure that medical items are handled properly in order to promote and inspire businesses and other stakeholders. The market for drone deliveries is anticipated to expand in the upcoming year as a result of increased investment, partnerships and collaboration, and technical advances. There is no denying that drones have countless applications in the healthcare system, but in order to ensure their widespread adoption in the system, issues with their high cost, laws and regulations, social acceptance, and technological problems must be resolved.

### 6.4.3 The Influence of COVID on Drones

What can we infer about COVID-19 and drones? The drone business does not seem to have suffered financially greatly from the outbreak. The fact that industry executives entered 2020 worried about the consumer market for flying drones for fun had perhaps even aided it. That might not be the case anymore. In a January 2021 study, market analysts at NPD said that sales of consumer drones “soared” during the pandemic, with revenues more than tripling from March to November of 2020 in comparison to 2019. This was likely due to individuals who were imprisoned looking for socially distant hobbies. According to a research on the drone’s hardware market published in April 2021, sales of drones used for agriculture spraying increased by a staggering 135%, with Asia accounting for the majority of the gain.

According to DroneDeploy, a significant drone map-making software provider, business in April 2020 was up 130% over April 2019 according to Fast Company. Many drone delivery businesses, like Zipline, seem to have profited greatly from the surge in interest in their services. According to certain estimates, the worldwide drone industry will reach $6.15 billion by 2023, a significant increase from the $3.64 billion revenue recorded in 2020.

However, COVID-19 has also made it more difficult for the drone sector to market products that are popularly seen as “normal” and unremarkable due to associations with authoritarian authority. Over the past 10 years, camera-equipped drones have proven to be a crucial tool for a variety of civil endeavors, including ecological research, planning for transportation, disaster management, winemaking, and other activities. Nevertheless, most of the people still have a mistrust for drones and the people who use them. With a land size of 3.28 million square kilometers, cleaning and disinfecting created a significant task and threat for public sanitation personnel using a manual spraying procedure. To reduce the possibility of manual spraying employees and their families becoming infected with the virus, automated sanitation employing drones was implemented.

Small drones are not more fundamentally military than an iPhone, a typical digital camera, or an SUV, all of which are frequently utilized by police, but that is not how most people see them. Unfortunately, the government’s adoption of drone technology for crowd control during the COVID era may have increased the perception of drones as an instrument of oppression rather than making them seem friendly. If the epidemic makes it more difficult to use drones for benign purposes, it would be unfortunate.

### 6.4.4 Limitations of Drone Technology in the Healthcare Industry

Businesses and society will gain a lot from drone technology. However, a variety of considerations, from user privacy and safety to legal concerns and unfair use, add to the drawbacks of drones.

#### _6.4.4.1 Privacy_

Drone technology has a number of drawbacks even though its advantages are limitless. UAVs are easily exploited and have the potential to invade users’ privacy. Although many people want to use drones to maintain safety, doing so may infringe on many people’s rights in the name of public safety.

#### _6.4.4.2 Legal Concerns_

Although there are many uses for UAVs or drones, there are also worries regarding misuse and abuse. Many state law authorities still have regulations governing the usage of drones because of these worries. There are currently no laws protecting property against airborne trespassing.

UAV technology thus operates in a legal limbo. Government rules and any state or local legislation that regulate airspace property rights are at odds with one another. Many individuals might not enjoy the concept of being observed by the unknown as a drone pilot can fly wherever he or she chooses.

#### _6.4.4.3 Rapid Transit—One of the Biggest Drawbacks of Drones is Time_

Drones run on rechargeable batteries; hence, they are unable to go great distances. The trip time is further lowered in cases of heavy winds because a drone may fly for up to 30 min. One of the main issues for consumers is the short flying time, which also ranks as one of the largest drawbacks of drones. Drones may go up to 5 km in that period, but they must return to their starting point, which takes time.

#### _6.4.4.4 Bugs in the Technology_

A drone cannot handle lithium-ion batteries, sensors, weight, or air pressure. Additionally, a novice pilot may be more risky due to the need to avoid potential hazards while in the air.

The major drawback of drones that carry ammunition is that software or hardware failures might result in many deaths. Drones are continually being developed to reduce incidents that might jeopardize the safety of human beings.

#### _6.4.4.5 Dependence on Weather_

As long as the weather is sunny and clear, drones are trustworthy. If it is windy or stormy outside, using UAVs to transport goods will not be a suitable alternative. Drone flight is impossible on rainy days because lithium polymer batteries are extremely sensitive to moisture. For eCommerce enterprises, this issue poses a significant obstacle, and they may want to think about utilizing delivery vehicles.

Additionally, the fog obscures the field of view, making it challenging to fly a drone. Fog makes it difficult to see and contains small water droplets, both of which might cause the drone’s batteries to malfunction while it is in flight.

#### _6.4.4.6 Hackable Drone Technology_

One of the main drawbacks of drones, whether used for military operations or commercial purposes, is their vulnerability to hackers. Drones operate using preprogrammed commands and algorithms. Only the Internet system makes it possible to navigate and operate the aircraft.

Attacking a drone’s central control system makes it simple for hackers to take control of the drone. Without the original controller’s awareness, they may take complete control of UAVs. Additionally, hackers have the ability to extract confidential information, destroy or damage files, or even expose data to uninvited parties.

## 6.5 Conclusion

The growth of medical drone applications has advanced more slowly than other domains, despite the rapidly growing maturity of applications in different sectors like media, transportation, agriculture, infrastructure inspection, and other areas. It should also be remembered that medical applications are more difficult due to the urgency of clinical conditions, which frequently precludes control over date, time, and place. Research on airspace integration, safety, reaction times, participation expansion, and privacy best practices must be accelerated, in order to encourage the secure integration and creative use of drones. The demands of users should be researched and converted into functional requirements and design standards when building technologies that benefit both medical professionals and patients. Important medications are now being delivered to isolated communities and rural populations all over the world with the help of UAVs. When a disease threatens or obstructs road transit, they are frequently the greatest means to supply a product in the shortest amount of time. Delivering patient samples to central laboratories for testing more swiftly is essential during a pandemic like COVID-19 because it enables clinicians to decide on treatments earlier and advances patient results.
