# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This directory contains Vim learning materials and documentation, specifically focused on Vim editor commands and usage patterns. It's part of an Obsidian knowledge vault documenting various programming tools and techniques.

## File Structure

- **Vim 从入门到精通.md** - Comprehensive Vim tutorial in Chinese (104KB) covering everything from basics to advanced usage, sourced from vim-galore
- **vscode_vim_stage12_cheatsheet_with_copy_paste.md** - Practical cheat sheet with checkbox-based learning progression and real-world code examples
- **Vim 修改命令 c 系列完整对照表.md** - Complete reference table for Vim's `c` (change) command series with detailed examples and use cases

## Content Focus

The materials cover:
- Modal editing concepts (Normal, Insert, Visual, Command modes)
- Movement commands (`hjkl`, `w/e/b`, `0/$`, `gg/G`, `H/M/L`)
- Text objects and operators (`d`, `y`, `c` with motions)
- Advanced change commands (`ciw`, `ci"`, `ci(`, `ct`, `cf`)
- Search and navigation (`/`, `n`, `*`, `gd`)
- VSCode Vim integration specifics
- Progressive learning with checkboxes and practical examples

## Working with These Files

When editing or enhancing these materials:
- Maintain the pedagogical structure with examples
- Keep command explanations concise but practical
- Include real code examples for context
- Preserve the bilingual nature (Chinese main guide, English cheat sheets)
- Focus on practical, commonly-used commands over obscure features
- Maintain checkbox format for tracking learning progress in cheat sheets
- Use consistent table formatting for command reference materials
- Include both command syntax and practical usage examples

## Git Context

This is part of a larger Obsidian vault with automated backups. The directory structure suggests this is educational content rather than executable code.
