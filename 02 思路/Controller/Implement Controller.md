The controller is responsible not only for navigating and driving the tractor but also for controlling mounted implements such as:

- Seeders
    
- Sprayers
    
- Plows
    
- Harvesters
This subsystem handles all interactions with mounted equipment, using standardized or custom protocols.
#### Key Responsibilities:

- Read implement status (e.g., position, operational state)
    
- Execute commands (e.g., start spraying, lift plow)
    
- Adjust implement parameters based on real-time data (e.g., adjust seeding rate based on speed or soil condition)
    
- Coordinate implement actions with tractor movement (e.g., raise plow before turning)
