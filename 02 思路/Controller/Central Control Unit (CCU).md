The **Central Control Unit** is the processing brain of the autonomous tractor system. It coordinates perception, decision-making, and actuation by integrating data from sensors, executing control algorithms, and communicating with tractor subsystems and mounted implements.

## Core Functions

1. **Sensor Fusion and State Estimation**
    
    - Collects and fuses data from environmental and tractor state sensors (GNSS/RTK, IMU, LiDAR, cameras, engine sensors, etc.).
        
    - Estimates the tractor’s real-time position, orientation, and operational status.
        
    - Provides a unified data model for navigation, safety, and implement control.
        
2. **Path Planning**
    
    - Generates navigation paths based on field geometry, task requirements, and obstacle maps.
        
    - Supports automated route generation from predefined geometric shapes, converting them into waypoints and coordinates.
        
    - Optimizes routes for efficiency, coverage, and minimal overlap.
        
3. **Motion Control**
    
    - Executes control loops to follow planned paths precisely.
        
    - Interfaces with tractor actuators via CAN bus or other control protocols.
        
    - Adjusts throttle, steering, braking, and gear shifting to maintain trajectory and speed.
        
4. **Task Execution**
    
    - Manages agricultural operations such as plowing, seeding, or spraying.
        
    - Coordinates with the **Implement Controller** to operate mounted equipment in sync with tractor movement.
        
5. **Safety Monitoring and Emergency Handling**
    
    - Continuously checks system health and environment for hazards.
        
    - Supports immediate manual override or emergency stop.
        
    - Implements fail-safe procedures for communication loss or critical errors.

## Implementation Notes

- **Hardware Platform**:
    
    - Embedded Linux system with real-time processing capability (e.g., STM32MP2 with NPU, NVIDIA Jetson, or Raspberry Pi with RT patches).
        
    - Integrated AI acceleration for perception and decision-making tasks.
        
- **Distributed Control**:
    
    - Some control functions may be offloaded to local controllers near sensors or actuators to reduce communication load and improve real-time performance.
        
- **Software Stack**:
    
    - Based on **ROS 2** for modularity, distributed nodes, and real-time communication.
        
    - Middleware supports both high-bandwidth data (e.g., video, LiDAR) and low-latency control signals.

## Additional Design Considerations

### Safety Design

- Redundant sensor inputs and watchdog timers.
    
- Hardware emergency stop circuits independent of the main processor.
    
- Fail-operational mode for critical systems.
    

### Power Management

- Separate power domains for control electronics, sensors, and actuators.
    
- Backup power for CCU to ensure controlled shutdown in case of main power failure.
    

### Communication Protocols

|Communication Protocol|Description|
|---|---|
|**ISOBUS (ISO 11783)**|Standard for implement-tractor interface|
|**CANopen / J1939**|For custom or low-level control|
|**GPIO/PWM/Analog**|For retrofitted or legacy implements|
|**Modbus/TCP/Serial**|For industrial machinery|

## Example Coordination Scenario – Autonomous Seeding

1. **GNSS/RTK** module provides real-time positioning.
    
2. CCU generates the optimal seeding path.
    
3. Motion control adjusts throttle and steering to follow the path.
    
4. **Implement Controller** (via ISOBUS) coordinates with the tractor:
    
    - Start seeding when entering a field row.
        
    - Adjust seeding rate based on current speed.
        
    - Stop seeding when reaching the end of a row or field boundary.
