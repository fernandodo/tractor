The safety subsystem ensures that the autonomous tractor operates within defined safety limits, can respond to unexpected hazards, and provides immediate manual override capabilities. It combines **preventive measures**, **real-time monitoring**, and **emergency response functions**.

## 1. Core Safety Functions

|Safety Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Watchdog / Reset Interface**|Hardware and software watchdogs monitor CCU health. If a health check fails, the system relinquishes control to safe state (manual mode or full stop).|
|**Geofencing & Speed Limiting**|The tractor operates only within predefined geographic boundaries and speed limits.|
|**Obstacle Detection & Avoidance**|Uses LiDAR, radar, or infrared to detect obstacles; automatically adjusts path or stops.|
|**Emergency Stop Button**|Large, easily accessible button for immediate manual stop.|
|**Emergency Braking**|One-touch emergency braking via dedicated safety circuit, bypassing main controller if needed.|
|**Slope Safety (“Over-slope” Protection)**|Monitors tilt angle; triggers audible and visual alerts (horn + lights) and shuts down if slope exceeds safe threshold.|
|**Lighting for Visibility**|LED headlights and warning lights for night or low-visibility operation.|
|**Signal Loss Handling**|If communication between CCU and control system is lost, automatically stop operations and disable implements.|
|**Hydraulic & Lubrication Pressure Monitoring**|If abnormal pressure is detected, halt operation and shut down relevant subsystems.|
|**Automatic Obstacle Avoidance**|Laser or infrared-based short-range obstacle avoidance for last-moment hazard prevention.|

## 2. Safety Design Principles

1. **Fail-Safe Defaults** – All critical controls revert to a safe state (e.g., brakes engaged, PTO disengaged) on fault detection.
    
2. **Redundancy** – Use multiple sensor types for critical measurements (e.g., obstacle detection via both LiDAR and radar).
    
3. **Isolation** – Emergency systems operate independently of the main CCU to ensure they work even if the CCU fails.
    
4. **Operator Alerts** – Audible and visual indicators for critical warnings.
    
5. **Testing and Certification** – Conforms to relevant agricultural machinery safety standards (e.g., ISO 4254, ISO 25119).

## 3. Safety Event Workflow

1. **Detection** – Sensors detect hazard or system fault.
    
2. **Assessment** – CCU evaluates severity and decides if immediate action is needed.
    
3. **Response** –
    
    - **Low severity**: Adjust operation, notify operator.
        
    - **High severity**: Trigger emergency stop, shut down systems.
        
4. **Recovery** – System remains in safe state until manual reset or fault is cleared.
